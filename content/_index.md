Welcome! This is the personal site for Michael T. Lawson, data scientist and writer from Boston, MA. If you're here, you likely know me for one of three reasons:

1. I am a data scientist, currently working at Klaviyo as a Data Science Manager. This is also where my academic background lies -- before Klaviyo, I was in the Biostatistics department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, finishing up my PhD in machine learning methods for precision medicine. You can find a list of my published academic works on my Writing page. 

2. I am a writer, most often published in poetry. My work appears or is forthcoming in *Tar River Poetry*, *Spoon River Poetry Review*, *Nimrod International Journal*, *Grist Journal*, and *Ninth Letter*, among others. You can find links to my published work on my Writing page. 

3. I am the host of two podcasts: the Klaviyo Data Science Podcast, a podcast about data science, software engineering, and all the things that are necessary to make those happen; and the Slumscast, a podcast about genuinely trying and spectacularly failing to be good at the card game Netrunner. You can find more information and links to both on my Podcasts page.
