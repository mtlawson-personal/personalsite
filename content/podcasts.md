The [Slumscast](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/slumscast) is a podcast about genuinely trying and spectacularly failing at being good at the card game Netrunner. Join us for an irreverent but insightful view into Netrunner past, present, and future, including fan-favorite segments such as *Baking Up Thinkloaves*, *The Bad Card of the Week That's Still Bad and You Still Shouldn't Play It*, and *Ban or Nab*. From time to time, we also interview members of the Netrunner community, including current and former world champions and current and former Lead Designers of the game. 

I am the co-founder, co-producer, and co-host of the Slumscast.
